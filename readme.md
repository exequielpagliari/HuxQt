# Hux
Hux is a WYSIAWYG ("What You See Is (Almost) What You Get") terminal script editor for [Aleph One](https://alephone.lhowon.org/), developed using [Qt](https://www.qt.io/). The GUI allows users to create, edit, and preview terminals in any AO-compatible scenario, with controls provided for image and text alignment, formatting, etc. 

All necessary operations can be done through the tool, minimizing the risk of errors caused by incorrect syntax, and reducing the time cost of creating/editing terminals.

The app was developed using Qt version 5.12.9, but it should be compatible with newer versions.

_NOTE: Hux provides a close, but not 1:1 representation of Aleph One's terminal rendering. All scripting content is preserved, but there can be small differences in the displayed result (e.g line wrapping)_

## Getting started

### Scenario Editor

This is the main window that is first displayed when the app is loaded. The left side of the window shows the scenario browser and information tables for terminals and screens. The right side shows a preview display for the currently selected screen. The buttons can be used to navigate between a terminal's screens.

_TODO: images_

### Loading Scenarios

Hux uses split folders generated by [Atque](https://sourceforge.net/projects/igniferroque/) to load the terminal data. Changes made to the terminal scripts will need to be merged again before they can be tested in-game.

To load a scenario, simply click _File -> Open Scenario_ and select the root directory of a split scenario generated by Atque. The scenario browser will display all 

### Editing Scenarios

1. Right-clicking nodes in the scenario browser tree allows users to create, modify, move, and delete scenario elements.
2. Double-clicking a terminal opens the terminal edit dialog, allowing the user to change the terminal ID and teleport behavior.
3. Selecting a screen node will display its preview on the right side of the scenario editor. Double-clicking the node will open the screen in the Screen Editor.
4. Only levels with a valid .sceA file can be added to the Scenario Browser (this will generate a new terminal script file with a matching name)

### Editing Screens

1. Opening a screen from the Scenario Browser opens a tab in the Screen Editor, which shows the current contents of the screen, along with a visual preview.
2. Users can change the screen type (e.g LOGON, PICT, etc.), change the resource ID, edit the text, and apply formatting (for a guide to the terminal syntax, please consult INSERT LINK HERE)
3. When editing screen types that use images (LOGON/LOGOFF/PICT), double-clicking the resource ID line edit will open the PICT Browser, where users can select the appropriate PICT resource to be displayed.
4. PICT screens allow users to modify the alignment (LEFT/CENTER/RIGHT). CENTER screens must not have any text.
5. For any other screen types, the resource ID is used as the screen attribute (e.g TAG screens use this as the TAG ID)
6. The screen preview automatically updates after any edits are made to the contents or other attributes.

### Saving Scenarios

Click _File -> Save Scenario_, which opens the Export Dialog. This will list all the levels and allows the user to preview the exported terminal script. Double-clicking a level will open a tab with the text that will be used to overwrite any existing terminal script.
